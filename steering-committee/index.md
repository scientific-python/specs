# Description

The Scientific Python Ecosystem Coordination (SPEC) process is managed by
the SPEC Steering Committee (SSC).
The SSC does not decide which SPECs are adopted—that choice resides with
individual projects.
Similarly, the SSC does not decide which SPECs are endorsed—that choice resides
with individual core projects.
They do, however,

- monitor and moderate the
  [`specs` discussion forum](https://discuss.scientific-python.org/c/specs/6),
- determine which proposed SPECS are accepted as described in the SPEC
  [Purpose and Process]({{< relref "/specs/purpose-and-process/index.md" >}}),
- approve changes to the SPEC process including any changes to the
  [SPEC Purpose and Process]({{< relref "/specs/purpose-and-process/index.md" >}}),
  [SPEC Steering Committee]({{< relref "/specs/purpose-and-process/index.md" >}}), and
  [SPEC Core Projects]({{< relref "/specs/purpose-and-process/index.md" >}}), as well as
- serve as a communication channel to and from projects they contribute to as
  well as the larger ecosystem.

# Implementation

To accept a SPEC (i.e., to assign it a SPEC number and merge the PR)
requires two members of the SSC to approve and no members objecting.
Since the role of the SSC is to mainly ensure that SPEC proposals are
appropriate, objections should be rare.

To make changes to the SPEC process including to the
[SPEC Purpose and Process]({{< relref "/specs/purpose-and-process/index.md" >}}),
[SPEC Steering Committee]({{< relref "/specs/purpose-and-process/index.md" >}}), or
[SPEC Core Projects]({{< relref "/specs/purpose-and-process/index.md" >}}),
the SSC makes decisions through group consensus and, in the very rare instance
where no consensus can be reached, by two-thirds majority vote of those
available to cast a vote within ten days.

Public communication takes place in the
[`specs` GitHub repository](https://github.com/scientific-python/specs/)
and the [`specs` discussion](https://discuss.scientific-python.org/c/specs/6).
Private communication within the SSC takes place on
[SSC private mailing list](https://groups.io/g/spec-steering-committee/).
SSC members are expected to be aware of conversations on this list to lend validity
to consensus-seeking and voting.

## Who should be a member?

Members of the SSC should be active in the scientific Python ecosystem and
should have a demonstrated interest in the SPECs.
Examples of demonstrated interest include submitting SPECs, engaging in SPEC
discussions, reviewing SPEC PRs, or advocating for wider SPEC participation.

## How many members should there be?

This is up to the SSC.
However, if the SSC is unable to quickly handle new SPEC proposals and new ideas arising
in the discussions aren't addressed in a timely manner, the SSC should try to
recruit new members.

## How do you add a member?

If the SSC decides to admit a new member and that person agrees,
then they should
(1) be added to the SSC member listing above,
(2) be added to the
[SSC Team](https://github.com/orgs/scientific-python/teams/spec-steering-committee/members),
(3) be added to the [SSC private mailing list](https://groups.io/g/spec-steering-committee/members).

## How do you remove a member?

If a member wishes to resign or if the SSC decides to remove a member,
then they should
(1) be moved to the list of Emeritus SSC members (below the list of active members),
(2) be removed from the
[SSC Team](https://github.com/orgs/scientific-python/teams/spec-steering-committee/members),
(3) be removed from the [SSC private mailing list](https://groups.io/g/spec-steering-committee/members).
