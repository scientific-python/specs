def _transition_to_rng(old_name, *, position_num=None, end_version=None):
    """Example decorator to transition from old PRNG usage to new `rng` behavior

    Suppose the decorator is applied to a function that used to accept parameter
    `old_name='random_state'` either by keyword or as a positional argument at
    `position_num=1`. At the time of application, the name of the argument in the
    function signature is manually changed to the new name, `rng`. If positional
    use was allowed before, this is not changed.*

    - If the function is called with both `random_state` and `rng`, the decorator
      raises an error.
    - If `random_state` is provided as a keyword argument, the decorator passes
      `random_state` to the function's `rng` argument as a keyword. If `end_version`
      is specified, the decorator will emit a `DeprecationWarning` about the
      deprecation of keyword `random_state`.
    - If `random_state` is provided as a positional argument, the decorator passes
      `random_state` to the function's `rng` argument by position. If `end_version`
      is specified, the decorator will emit a `FutureWarning` about the changing
      interpretation of the argument.
    - If `rng` is provided as a keyword argument, the decorator validates `rng` using
      `numpy.random.default_rng` before passing it to the function.
    - If `end_version` is specified and neither `random_state` nor `rng` is provided
      by the user, the decorator checks whether `np.random.seed` has been used to set
      the global seed. If so, it emits a `FutureWarning`, noting that usage of
      `numpy.random.seed` will eventually have no effect. Either way, the decorator
      calls the function without explicitly passing the `rng` argument.

    If `end_version` is specified, a user must pass `rng` as a keyword to avoid warnings.

    After the deprecation period, the decorator can be removed, and the function
    can simply validate the `rng` argument by calling `np.random.default_rng(rng)`.

    * A `FutureWarning` is emitted when the PRNG argument is used by
      position. It indicates that the "Hinsen principle" (same
      code yielding different results in two versions of the software)
      will be violated, unless positional use is deprecated. Specifically:

      - If `None` is passed by position and `np.random.seed` has been used,
        the function will change from being seeded to being unseeded.
      - If an integer is passed by position, the random stream will change.
      - If an instance of `RandomState` is passed by position, either an
        error will be raised (NumPy < 2.2.0), or it will be accepted
        (NumPy >= 2.2.0) but the random numbers generated may be different
        from those that would be produced by the original `RandomState`.
      - If `np.random` is passed by position, an error will be raised.

      We suggest that projects consider deprecating positional use of
      `random_state`/`rng` (i.e., change their function signatures to
      ``def my_func(..., *, rng=None)``); that might not make sense
      for all projects, so this SPEC does not make that
      recommendation, neither does this decorator enforce it.

    Parameters
    ----------
    old_name : str
        The old name of the PRNG argument (e.g. `seed` or `random_state`).
    position_num : int, optional
        The (0-indexed) position of the old PRNG argument (if accepted by position).
        Maintainers are welcome to eliminate this argument and use, for example,
        `inspect`, if preferred.
    end_version : str, optional
        The full version number of the library when the behavior described in
        `DeprecationWarning`s and `FutureWarning`s will take effect. If left
        unspecified, no warnings will be emitted by the decorator.
