## Description

This SPEC describes what governance is, and offers recommendations for choosing a
governance model for open-source projects.

Open-source project communities are amalgamations of software and the humans who
use and maintain it. Governance models define methods for decision-making
within a project, roles for the community members imbued with decision-making
authority, and processes for filling (and, if needed, vacating) those
leadership roles. In the context of open-source software projects, governance
models often also define the granting of necessary permissions or access to
organization secrets necessary for the implementation of project-related
decisions. Governance models are complementary to Codes of Conduct and
Community Guidelines, which define the expectations and responsibilities of all
participants in a project (including users of the software), regardless of
their status as a project leader (cf. SPEC XXX), ensuring the long-term
sustainability of a project.

The open source communities interact and contribute through various mediums,
such as distributed version control systems, chat platforms, blog posts,
discussion forums, mailing lists, and social media. Having clear guidelines for
participation helps maintain a continuous stream of contributions.

This SPEC outlines the definition of governance, various open-source governance
models, the steps to choose the right governance model, and what needs to be
done post-adoption.

Please note that these are recommendations and not bylaws. If you have
suggestions/thoughts, we're more than happy to consider them.

## Implementation

### Choosing a governance model

When you define governance for a project, you need to identify a few things:

- What roles does maintainers, core team, contributors, and community members
  play in the project?
- What authority, duties, and privileges are associated with each role?
- How do people get assigned to and removed from roles?
- How are decisions made and documented within the project?
- What are the methods for resolving conflicts?

There are few **pre-defined models** for governance used across open-source
projects. We'll mention them here for reference:

- BDFL
  - BDFL stands for 'Benevolent Dictator for Life.' Under this structure, one
    person (usually the project's initial author) has the final say on all
    major project decisions. Smaller projects are BDFL by default because
    there are only one or two maintainers.
  - BDFL model template → http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/benevolentdictatorgovernancemodel
- Meritocracy / Do-ocracy
  - Decisions are made by contributors who have demonstrated merit through
    their contributions to the project. Merit is often gained through
    code contributions, documentation improvements, or other significant efforts.
  - Meritocracy model template → http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/meritocraticgovernancemodel
- Self appointing council / committee / board
  - This model appoints a board or committee to govern various aspects of a
    project. Those groups are often called the steering committee, committer
    council, technical operation committee, board of directors, etc. This
    model might be helpful for projects that need a sponsoring foundation,
    and projects for which establishing electoral mechanisms is challenging.
- Electoral
  - The community elects the leadership or decision-making
    body. This model aims to ensure that those who guide the project's
    direction and make crucial decisions are chosen democratically,
    representing the broader community's interests.
- Foundation backed
  - A non-profit foundation oversees the project, and its governance
    structures often include a board of directors, technical committees, and
    working groups.

**Other governance models**

- Liberal contribution
  - Under a liberal contribution model, the people who do the most work are
    recognized as influential. Major project decisions are made based on a
    consensus-seeking process (discussing major grievances) rather than pure
    vote, and the team strives to include as many community perspectives as
    possible.
  - Example: Node.js liberal contribution policy → https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/healthy-open-source-967fa8be7951
- C4 (Collective Code Construction Contract)

### How to pick the appropriate governance model?

Choosing the right governance model for your open-source project involves
considering several factors to ensure the structure aligns with your project’s
goals, community, and resources. Most open-source projects start with the BDFL
model; eventually, they grow and adopt more open models.

A few things you should consider while choosing the appropriate model for your project:

- **Project lifecycle stage**
  - Early stage
  - Growth stage
  - Mature stage
- **Assess your project's needs and goals**
  - Project size and complexity
  - Community involvement
- **Evaluate available resources**
  - Leadership and management capacity
- **Community dynamics**
  - Large, diverse communities might benefit from democratic or meritocratic
    models to represent various interests
  - Smaller, homogeneous communities are more suited for a BDFL model
- **Technical and Operational Complexity**
  - Complex projects with numerous sub-projects or components may need a
    structured governance model to manage them effectively
- **Flexibility and Adaptability**
  - Choose a model that allows for future adjustments as the project evolves
  - Implement mechanisms for regular feedback from the community on governance
    effectiveness
- **External Stakeholders**
  - Consider how partnerships with other projects, organizations, or companies
    might influence governance
- **Legal and financial considerations**
  - If the project needs to be incorporated as a non-profit, foundation, or
    under a company
  - Assess the sources of funding and how they influence governance

### What to do after the adoption?

Once a project has adopted a governance model, the several important steps could
be followed to ensure smooth implementation and operation.

- **Document the governance model**
  - Clearly document the governance model, including roles, responsibilities,
    decision-making processes, and procedures for conflict resolution.
  - https://communityrule.info/templates/ offers an excellent interface where
    you can create a `.md` for your governance model
- **Communicate to the Community**
  - Make a public announcement about the adoption of the new governance model
  - Provide an overview of how the governance model works, why it was chosen,
    and what it means for the community
- **Implement the governance structure**
  - Assign initial roles and responsibilities
  - Form any necessary committees, councils, or boards as defined by the
    governance model
- **Fostering community engagement and ensuring transparency and
  accountability**
  - Provide regular updates and reports to the community on governance
    activities, decisions, and project progress
  - Establish mechanisms for the community to provide feedback on the
    governance model and its implementation
  - Maintain transparency by making all governance-related documentation,
    meeting minutes, and decisions publicly available. You can use public
    repository or a website for this.
- **Establish Conflict Resolution Processes**
  - Implement formal mechanisms for resolving conflicts within the community
    and governance bodies. Ensure these mechanisms are fair, transparent,
    account for diversity and inclusion, and accessible to all community
    members.
