# Description

- projects have separate enhancement proposal processes and development contraints
- specs are cross-project recommendations to better coordinate the ecosystem and
  provide a more unified experience for users.

- ep are debated / accepted by the projects themselves often using something
  like consensus
- specs are different in that  

  - we don't expect every spec will be immdediately adopted by all projects
  - some will never be adopted by all projects

- yet for specs to be meaningful they need to be adopted by several projects
- and this adoption has to be approved by those projects independently

## Steering Committee

we will start with 

- numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas, statsmodels, scikit-image, scikit-learn, networkx

we hope other projects will join

each project should appoint 1 representative to serve on the spec steering committtee

the spec sc is responsible for
- serving as a communication channel to and from their projects 
- proposing new specs,
- accepting new projects to provide members to the spec steering committtee
- maintaining and approving specs including the process specs

it is up to each project to decide how they will determine whether their
project adopts a spec or not

## Contributors

who can submit a new SPEC?

Any community member can propose a new SPEC by following the procedure...

Contributors should read our [Code of Conduct]({{< ref
"/about/code_of_conduct.md" >}}).

# Implementation

for projects that already have an ep process in place, we recommend they
create a new ep to list the specs they have adopted including links to their
project discussions leading to adoption.

they should also add their project to the spec_adopted_by tag for the spec.
